# SAGE-GAN
SAGE-GAN: Our proposed model which consists of a self-attention U-Net which is pretrained from scratch on a small set of real EM images to accurately segment nanoparticle features while suppressing background noise. This pretrained U-Net is then embedded into a CycleGAN (cGAN-Seg) architecture, enabling the generation of synthetic EM images that are structurally aligned with ground-truth masks via cycle consistency. This integration enhances nanoparticle segmentation accuracy and robustness, especially in data-limited scenarios. This repository contains the scripts for training and evaluating our model, as well as the publicly available S1 nanoparticle dataset upon which this model was trained.
